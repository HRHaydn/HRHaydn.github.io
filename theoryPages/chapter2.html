					Pipelining is a situation where the output of one process is the input of another.<br>
					RISC architecture is often linked with pipelining. While one instruciton is being fetched, another is being decoded and another executed. This is queueing and does have its drawbacks in the form of flushing the pipeline. This is where an interrupt takes place and takes priority, meaning the pipelining needs to be reset.<br>

				<div class="col-lg-12">
				<p class="lead"><br><strong>What is abstraction?</strong><br><br>
				This is the process by which what does matter is brought out and what doesn't is discarded in a scenario. <br>
				Abstraction helps us to maximise our chances of solving a problem by letting us separate out the component parts and decide which are worth developing with more detail.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Abstraction and real-world issues</strong><br><br>
				Abstraction is extremely important in computing. Every program worth thinking about uses variables. Variables are an abstraciton of real world values or itermediate values in calculations.<br>
				Classes and objects in object oriented programming are another example of abstraction on a higher level.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Levels of abstraction</strong><br><br>
				In a complex system, it is often useful to construct an abstractipon to represent a large problem and to create lower-level abstractions to deal with component parts.<br>
				The power in this approach is the details in each layer of abstraction can be hidden from the others allowing concentration on just one issue at a time. <br>
				This idea of levels is called layering and is found widely in large systems such as Operating Systems, Databases and Networking. Layers are a way of dividing the functionality of a big system into separate areas of interest.

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-lg-12">
				<p class="lead"><br><br><strong>Thinking Ahead</strong><br>
				In computing, when we refer to planning and thinking ahead we refer to inputs and output. It is useful to apply this approach to other problems as well.<br><br>
				<strong>Inputs and Outputs</strong><br>
				When planning a computer system, one of the first things an analyst needs to do is to determine what outputs are needed, after all the entire purpose of a computer system is to have and retrieve output. This use of determining outputs leads to information of required inputs and thus planning ahead in a computer system.<br><br>
				<strong>Caching</strong><br>
				This is another illustration of thinking ahead in computer systems. Data that is likely to be needed is anticipitated and stored in a temporary store, ready for fast access. Cached data can replace the need for recalculation or slow access of data stored online or on an external storage device.<br><br>
				<br><strong>Thinking Procedurally</strong><br>
				Computers are written and designed in modules of code and essential components.<br>
				When writing programs, we generally think of algorithms expressed as sequences of instructions which are often packaged up into modules for ease of writing.<br>
				</p>
				<ul class="lead">
				<li>
				Divide up a problem into sub-problems
				</li>
				<li>
				Do solutions already exist for any of the sub-problems?
				</li>
				<li>
				How do the sub-problems interact with each other?
				</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p class="lead">
				<br><strong>Thinking Logically</strong><br>
				When we think logically, we have to infer knowledge. In programming it requires understanding where decisions need to be made and their consequences.<br>
				To think logically when solving a problem, it is necessary to:
				</p>
				<ul class="lead">
				<li>
				identify when decision making is required
				</li>
				<li>
				identify what decisions need to be made 
				</li>
				<li>
				identify the test conditions to enable a decision to be made 
				</li>
				<li>
				understand the interactions between decisions 
				</li>
				<li>
				apply decision making to the real-world problems
				</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="lead">
				<br><strong>Thinking Concurrently</strong><br>
				Sometimes it can be more efficient to do some parts of a task together at the same time. This is the idea of concurrently approaching a problem and can affect the algorithms created. This links in to hardware such as parallel processing and other forms of problem solving in computer science.

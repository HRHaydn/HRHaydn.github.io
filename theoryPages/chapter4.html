			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-lg-12">
					<p class="lead">
					<br>There are 3 basic constructs that have remained the same with computing and algorithms. These are sequence, selection and iteration.
					<br><br>
					<strong>Sequence</strong>
					<br>There isn't a lot to sequence. This is the execution of statements or functions one after another. The majority of code will usually involve just sequences of instructions.
					<br><br>
					</p>
					<img class="pull-right img-responsive featurette-image" src="../img/selection.png" width="300px">
					<p class="lead">
					<strong>Selection</strong>
					<br>This is where a decision is made in a program and control is passed to another point in the program. The decision is based on a Boolean (a data type that is either true or false, 1 or 0, etc) expression. 
					<br>In low level languages such as LMC (Little Man Computer), this decision making is achieved with branching such as BRA or BRZ.
					<br>In high level languages this is seen with IF statements and ELSE statements. 
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
					<strong>Iteration</strong>
					<br>Similar to selection a Boolean expression controls the state of the expression, however this time a section of code is repeated instead. 
					<br><br>There are 3 main types of iteration that occur in high level languages:<br>
					<br><strong>Reapeat...until</strong><br>
					This iteration tests the condition at the end of the repetition of code. This is always repeated at least once.
					<br><strong>While...do</strong><br>
					This iterations tests the condition at the start of the repetition of code. Therefore the loop may not occur at all.
					<br><strong>For...do</strong><br>
					This loops exectutes a set number of times, controlled by a variable.

				<div class="col-lg-12">
					<p class="lead"><br><strong>Global and Local Variables</strong><br>
					Variables are names given to values that can change during a program. These variables have a data type that is usually fixed during a program. 
					<br>Variables can be local or global. 
					<br><br>A local variable is one declared inside a sub-program. Due to this it is only accessible within this sub-program. It is good practise to use mostly local variables as there will be less chance of conflicts and other modules getting affected.  
					<br>A global variable is one which is usually declared outside any sub-programs.

					<p class="lead">
					<strong>Functions and Procedures</strong>
					<br>Programs are often made up of sub-programs or modules. Of which there are two types, functions and procedures. It is important to note there is not much difference between the two, however there is one real difference.
					<br><br>Functions must return a value. That is they are a set of mathematical operations that will produce a result at the end, known as returning a value. A procedure however does not have to return a value and instead is a set of instructions

					<p class="lead">
					<br><strong>Parameter Passing</strong>
					<br>Functions and procedures can accept values. This makes them flexible so that their programming can respond to various inputs of data. There are multiple ways to do this, however the two common methods is passing by value and passing by reference.
					<br><br>When you pass by reference, the original value of the variable given is changed. One example of this is with the total bill. The total bill will need to be modified with various modules, however the end value needs to be changed each time it is passed to different modules to produce the end variable.
					<br><br>The opposite of this is passing by value, this is where the original value of the variable is not changed, in essence only the value of the variable is given. For example in databases or lists, you might not want the original entry to change, even if you are manipulating the data in modules.

					<strong>Integrated Development Environments (IDE)</strong>
					<br>To write code the only software that is needed is a text editor. To translate the code you need an assembler, a compiler or an interpreter. Finally to put together this compiled code you need a linker. It is easier to do this with a single specifically designed software called an IDE. 
					<br><br>There are various things that an IDE may include, below are some examples:
					</p>
					<ul class="lead">
					<li>
					an editor for writing the source code (the code written in the programming language)
					</li>
					<li>
					facilities for automating the build (all the actions required to produce a finished working program)
					</li>
					<li>
					a debugger
					</li>
					<li>
					features to help with code writing, such as pretty printing (colouring code) and code completion
					</li>		
					</ul>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-lg-12">
				<p class="lead">
				<br>While high level languages are easier for humans to understand, we need a way of converting them into a form a CPU can use. There are two types of translator program used to do this, interpreters and compilers. 
				<br><br><strong>Interpreter</strong>
				<br>An interpreter takes each line of high-level language program, converts it into machine code and runs it.  This is useful when debugging a program as the program can start running straight away and will stop at a line if it finds an error. The downside of this is that an interpreted program runs slowly. Every time the program is run, the user has to wait for the translation of each line as well as the execution. When iterating through a loop, the interpreter may have to translate the same line many times. </strong>
				<br><br><strong>Compiler</strong>
				<br>A compiler is a program that takes a program written in high level language and converts it into object code. This object code can then be distributed to anyone with compatible system without the need for any additional programs. Once the code is compiled, it can run as often as needed and much faster speed than an interpreted program. Also, if the source code were distributed commercially, people could amend it, removing anti piracy measures, debrand the product and sell it on and copy any innovative ideas into their own product, stealing the original creators hard work.  As machine code is not human readable doing any of these things is much harder.

				<div class="row">
				<div class="col-lg-12">
				<p class="lead">
				<br>There are various steps involved in compilation of code. 
				<br><br><strong>Lexical Analysis</strong>
				<br>All comments and whitespace are removed from the program.  Remember comments are just there for the programmers but are no use to the computer.
				<br><br><strong>Syntax Analysis</strong>
				<br>Syntax analysis checks that the code has been written to the rules of the the language.  Syntax analysis will produce an abstract syntax tree (AST) that will represent the program.
				<br><br><strong>Code Generation</strong>
				<br>By this stage, the program is represented as an abstract syntax tree and the compiler has all the data it needs. Code generation is when the compiler converts this into object code.
				<br><br><strong>Optimisation</strong>
				<br>The optimiser for the language will have a number of tricks that could remove lines of code that are not required, the optimiser can remove these lines and the program will run.  It will also look at groups of instructions to see if they can be made smaller.
				<br><br><strong>Libraries</strong>
				<br>We use libraries all the time when we are programing.  When you download the latest version of Python it comes with its standard libraries that allow you to print to screen using the print function and perform IF statements as well as a thousand more things you can do with a standard install of Python.  Sometimes you might want to use a specialist random function, so you would need to import the random library (module). 
				<br><br><strong>Linkers</strong>
				<br>The linker will bring in the external code from the libraries we looked at above into place holders that you wrote in your source code for example random.randint would be a place holder where the linker would look for the randint code from the random library that you imported.

					<p class="lead">Applications software is the software we use all the time when we turn on the computer to do a job. It is the software we download/buy to help us perform a task. These include:</p>
					<ul class="lead">
						<li>Word processors</li>
						<li>Spreadsheets</li>
						<li>Presentation</li>
						<li>Desktop Publishing</li>
						<li>Image Editors</li>
						<li>Web Browsers</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="lead"><br>Utility software is a relatively small program that has one purpose, usually concerned with the maintenance of the system. Below are some examples of this software:</p>
					<ul class="lead">
						<li>Anti-virus: Used to detect, isolate and remove or inform the user of potentially harming and malicious software intended to harm the computer. </li>
						<li>Disk Defragmentation: When files are deleted they create free space. When new files are created they may be spread over multiple smaller sections of free memory if the file is too large to fit in one space provided on the disk. Over time many programs can be placed over multiple sections of a hard drive which can slow down the operations of the computer. A disk defragmenter organises the memory so that programs are grouped wholly together.</li>
						<li>Compression: Reduce the amount of space a program or software takes up in storage. Often these algorithms take advantage of repetition within a program or reduce quality in order to store a smaller file. </li>
						<li>File Managers: Allows files and directories to be moved, copied, deleted and renamed. </li>
						<li>Backup Utilities: Allows backups to be automatically made of specified data. </li>
					</ul>
					
					<p class="lead">
					<br><br><strong>Operating Systems</strong>
					<br>There are four main tasks of an operating system:</p>
					<ul class="lead">
						<li>To manage the hardware of the system</li>
						<li>To manage programs installed and being run</li>
						<li>To manage the security of the system</li>
						<li>To provide an interface between the user and the computer</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class="lead"><strong>Multi-Tasking OS:</strong><br>
					An operating system is described as being multi-tasking if it is capable or running applications seemingly at the same time. By alternating between processors it is capable of providing the illusion that the programs are running simultaneously. This is even easier with more than one core in the CPU. </p>
					<br>
					<p class="lead"><strong>Multi-User OS:</strong><br>
					A multi-user operating system is one which allows more than one user to share the computer&rsquo;s resources simultaneously. This is not the same as different logins. Common on mainframe computers. </p>
					<br>
					<p class="lead"><strong>Distributed OS:</strong><br>
					A distributed operating system is one which can control and coordinate multiple computers at once, presenting them to the user as if they were a single system.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="lead"><strong>Embedded OS:</strong><br>
					Embedded operating systems are ones which are built into devices. Specifically designed for the device on which they run and with efficiency in mind. Some but not all embedded devices work on embedded operating systems. </p>
					<br>
					<p class="lead"><strong>Real-time OS:</strong><br>
					An operating system which carries out actions within a guaranteed amount of time even when left running for long periods of time is described as a real-time OS. Often the expected response time is within fractions of a second. These operating systems can more commonly be found in critical systems such as autopilots on a plane. </p>

				<p class="lead"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
				One of the key jobs of the OS is the management of memory, do not confuse this with management of secondary storage. Memory stores the programs and data currently in use by the computer. Memory management allows instructions and data to be stored in memory safely and efficiently.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="lead"><strong>Safety</strong><br>
				Each different program will be using its own data. We don&rsquo;t want one program changing the data of another. The management of memory restricts each program accessing and amending the data of another program.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="lead"><strong>Efficiency</strong><br>
				Swapping between jobs(Scheduling) needs to be carried out in such away that we are not waiting for jobs to complete before we can carry on with our tasks. To manage this programs are split up and loaded into memory as PAGES. Pages can be split in two ways LOGICALLY, split at logical points in a program eg for each modules or function. This is called SEGMENTATION. Or we could give each page a set size only a few KB each and it does not matter where we split them. This is called PAGING.</p>

				<p class="lead"><br><strong>Interrupts and Polling</strong><br>
				The CPU needs to know when a device needs its attention. There are two ways of doing this: Interrupts and Polling.</p>
				
				<p class="lead"><br><strong>Polling </strong><br>
				This is when the CPU keeps checking each peripheral to see if it needs attentions. This is a waste of the CPU&rsquo;s time. Imagine if a teacher went round each individual student in the whole class to see if they had a question, continuously throughout a lesson, no work would get done.
				<br><br>The alternative is for the student to politely the teacher. An interrupt will have a priority indicating how urgently it requires attention. When an interrupt is raised, the OS runs the relevant Interrupt Service Routine (ISR).</p>

				<p class="lead"><br><strong>Interrupt Service Routines (ISR)</strong><br>
				When a peripheral or software routine requires attention, an interrupt is raised to tell the CPU. Each interrupt has a priority level. If its priority is higher than the process currently being executed it needs to be serviced first. The OS has ISRs that will determine what happens when a particular interrupt is carried out.
				<br>At the end of each fetch-decode-execute cycle, the processor checks to see if there are any interrupts. If there are and they are of a higher priority than the current task the following steps are carried:</p>
				<ul class="lead">
				<li>The contents of the program counter and the other registers are copied to an area of memory called a stack.</li>
				<li>The relevant interrupt service routine can then be loaded by changing the program counter to the value where the ISR starts in memory.</li>
				<li>When the the interrupt service routine is complete, the previous values of the programs counter and other registers can be restored from memory into the CPU.</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="lead">It is possible that while one interrupt is running it can be interrupted by an Interrupt Service Routine of higher priority. In this case the interrupt currently being serviced is also added to the stack in memory. Once the interrupt is finished assuming this also has not been interrupted by another ISR, the previous interrupt will be restored back into the CPU, when this has finished then the previous task will be loaded back into the CPU.</p>

				<p class="lead"><br><strong>Device Drivers</strong>
				<br>OSs are expected to communicate with a wide variety of devices, each with different manufacturers and models. It would be impossible for the programmers of an OS to build in support for all the available devices in the world and also all the ones that would be developed in the future, as we don&rsquo;t even know what these devices would do!
				<br />This is why we need device drivers. A device driver is a piece of software supplied with the device which tells the OS how to communicate with the device.</p>
				
				<p class="lead"><br><strong>Virtual Machines (VM)</strong>
				<br>It is possible to write a program that has the same functionality as a physical computer. We call such programmes virtual machines. 

				<br>Common use of virtual machines is to run operating systems within another operating system. This might be because a program is needed that will not run on the host operating system or it might be because it offers a convenient way to test a program being developed on multiple platforms.

				<br><br>Because virtual machines are just programs and data, they have advantages over physical machines. They can be backed up and duplicated and more than one can run at any one time on the physical machine. It is for these reasons that many organisations are virtualizing their network infrastructure, making their servers a group of virtual machines running from a cluster of physical machines.

				<br><br>Another common use of virtual machine is for interpreting intermediate code. When programs are fully compiled they can only run on one architecture (CPU) that has the same instruction set. Interpreted code needs the computer to have the interpreter installed for the program to run. Intermediate code offers a compromise between these two approaches. 
				<br><br>When using a virtual machine the compiler will partially convert the source code into something called bytecode. This isn't machine code but is much more efficient representation than the original source code. Because it isn't machine code it can't be run directly on the processor. Instead, a virtual machine is used to read the code. Any device with this virtual machine can read this intermediate code. This means code can be highly portable. As hardware becomes cheaper and more powerful, virtual machines are likely to become more commonplace. 

				<p class="lead"><br><strong>BIOS</strong><br>
				BIOS stands for<strong> basic input/output system</strong>. When a computer is first switched on it looks to the BIOS to get it up and running, and so the processor&rsquo;s program counter points to the BIOS&rsquo;s memory.

				The BIOS will usually first check that the computer is functional, memory is installed and accessible and the processor is working. 
				<br><br>This is called the <strong>power on self test</strong>, POST. Once it has done this, it can use the boot loader program to load the operating system kernel into memory. The BIOS is stored on flash memory so that it can be updated. This also allows setting such as boot order of disks to be changed and saved by the user.</p>

				<p class="lead"><br><strong>Open and closed source software</strong>
				<br>When software is sold commercially it is compiled to machine code. This means users can run it without having to translate it. Most users would have no need for the program source code. It would not be wise for the company making software to supply it as it would mean uses could amend their software and steal their work.

				<br><br>There is a type of software called open source software OSS where source code is made publicly available. This means that users can modify software to suit their needs. It also means that anyone can have a part in the development of the software. One of the best known pieces of open source software is the operating system Linux. There are many variants of Linux and it was used as a basis for the Android operating system.

				<br><br>There are many advantages and disadvantages to open source software. One of the biggest advantages is price. As the source code is freely available, there would be little point in charging for it, therefore most open source software is free. Some companies make money by offering the software for free then offering paid support contracts to businesses that want it.

				<br><br>Open source projects tend to be supported by armies of volunteer coders and testers. They are often very competent, but they may not have the resources organisations have available and also the dedicated programming teams. For this reason, open-source projects can lack the polish of their commercial, closed source counterparts. On the other hand, large open source projects may have many programmers and testers working on them, which means software can be quickly and regularly updated.

				<br><br>Whether open source systems are more or less secure is subject to debate. Some argue that as the source code is freely available anyone can find security holes in the code. Supporters of open source would counter this claim stating this is what makes it so secure as there are many people checking the code to identify such problems.</p>

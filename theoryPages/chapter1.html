				<p class="lead"><br /><strong>Seymour Aubrey Paper </strong> was a South African-born American mathematician, computer scientist and educator. Throughout his career he spent a large proportion teaching and researching and MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Including the development and co-founder of Logo - a programming language aimed at helping students thinking ‘computationally’ - he also pioneered artificial intelligence and the constructionist movement in education. This movement was the idea that students develop mental models in their heads, and use information they already possess in order to gain new knowledge about the subject. 
<br />Logo was created as a tool to assist students in thinking about and solving problems. A small mobile robot called the “Logo Turtle” was developed. This device was shown to students, who would use it to solve simple problems. Continuing onwards, Papert also insisted that simplistic languages and/or programs that child can learn may also have functionality for expert users. 
Collaborating with manufacturer Lego, Lego Mindstorms robotics kits were named after Papert’s groundbreaking 1980’s book.

				<p class="lead"><br /><strong>Jeannette Wing</strong> is the corporate vice president of Microsoft Research and has been a heavy promoter of computational thinking. She has gone far to express the possibilities of computational thinking and abstraction techniques to help with not only programming and problem-solving inside the computing industry, but also outside in various other jobs and disciplines. Along with this she has worked in Universities such as the Carnegie Mellon University, United States and University of Southern California, also in the United States.

				<p class="lead"><br />Decomposition is the breaking down of problems into smaller, easier to handle problems and tasks. This has various advantages to dealing with the problem as a whole and is part of computational thinking. It is advantageous as it allows smaller parts of the problems to be dealt with individually and in more depth rather than examining the original problem as a whole. This therefore allows a problem to be tackled faster and more efficiently, as well as ensuring the problem itself is addressed rather than slight alterations. Decomposition can also help in finding areas to start when tackling a problem for the first time and in creating a checklist to do.

						<p class="lead col-lg-12"><br />Problems are harder to deal with when not broken down into smaller parts. By breaking a task down, we can more easily see and solve problems by breaking them down into smaller problems. 
This applies heavily in complex systems. A complicated program can be easier to understand once broken down into smaller areas and examined individual.
			<div class="smallSpacer" />
			<p class="lead col-lg-12"><strong>Example:</strong><br />Imagine you're making a cake. You would want to decompose the problem into various parts, in this case the parts will be ingredients and equipment.
			<br />Starting with ingredients you would break each down into how much you need to add and when to add them to the full ingredients.
			</p>
			<img class="img-responsive col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2" src="../img/decomposition2.png">
			<div>
			<p class="lead col-lg-12"><br />Similarily we can break down the equipment we will use so it is easier to identify which pieces of equipment we need to use and when we need to use them with each ingredient. This again is an example of decomposition.

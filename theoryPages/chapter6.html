					<br><strong>Introduction to programming types</strong>
					<br>With programming there are different approaches to how we go about the programming itself. This idea comes down to paradigms which is a way of thinking, which we can apply to how we program.
					<br><br>A common paradigm in programming is imperative programming. This is where the program essentially tell the computer what to do. It is direct and given in instructions. The two examples of this programming is procedural, and object-oriented programming.
					<br><br>An alternative to this imperative programming is declrative programming. This is where we tell the computer the qualities the solution should have. A common example of this is SQL (Standard Query Language). Some subtypes of declarative programming language are logic, and functional programming.#
					<br>
					<br><br><strong>Procedural Programming</strong>
					<br>Where instructions are given in sequence; selection to decide what a program does and iteration how many times the code is repeated. Programs are broken down into key blocks referred to as procedures and functions.
					<br><br><strong>Logic Programming</strong>
					<br>Rather than instructions, code provides “rules” and sets of facts which are then used to determine and find a given goal. 
					<br><br><strong>Functional Programming</strong>
					<br>A description of the solution is brought up through a collection of functions.

					<p class="lead">In an assembly language, we refer to its relationship with coding to be one to one. This is down to one line of code referring to one operation that the CPU can do. For example the mnemonic for ADD is one operation. However in high level languages we can have a one to many relation. That being that one line of code, can perform many operations. An example of this is multiplication, in which many additions and thus many operations take place from one line. 
					<br><br>An example of an assembly language that is extremely useful to get familiar with is the Little Man Computer (LMC) as it models the architecture of a simple computer and has all the basic features.
					<br><br><strong>Memory Addressing</strong>
					<br>When accessing memory locations in assembly code there are different methods of doing so. 
<br><br><strong>Direct Addressing:</strong>
<br>This is where the operand specifies a memory location. In this case saying LDA 5 means retrieve the value at memory address 5 and load into the accumulator.
<br><br><strong>Immediate Addressing:</strong>
<br>With this method, the operand is the inherent value and therefore LDA 3 would load the value of 3 into the accumulator.
<br><br><strong>Indirect Addressing:</strong>
<br>This is where the operand specifies the memory location that contains the value of the memory location we wish to retrieve and load into the accumulator. 
<br><br><strong>Indexed Addressing:</strong>
<br>One of the registers in the CPU is the index register. This is used for index addressing. The address given is the base address which is then added to the value in the index register. By incrementing the index register it is possible to iterate efficiently through an array.

					<strong>Classes and Objects:</strong>
					</p>
					<ul class="lead">
					<li>
					Act as templates for creating objects. 
					</li>
					<li>
					Contain the “attributes” of the objects, this includes relative variables and methods (procedures and functions) that the object will have. 
					</li>
					<li>
					When an object is created it will specify the value of the relative variables in the class and therefore creating the given object.
					</li>
					<li>
					Objects are therefore a collection of variables and methods. 
					</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="lead">
When an object is created it will specify the value of the relative variables in the class and therefore creating the given object.
<br><br>Objects are therefore a collection of variables and methods. 
A common explanation of classes and objects is the idea of a biscuit cutter as the class, and the biscuits being the objects. 
					
					<br><br><strong>Inheritance</strong>
					<br>This is where a class gains all the relative attributes of another class, however with the addition of its own attributes. 
<br>If there is a method inside of the original class that is not wanted, then the class can be overridden. 
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
					<br><strong>Polymorphism</strong>
					</p>
					<ul class="lead">
					<li>
					Means “many forms”
					</li>
					<li>
					This is where some operation or aspect has different meanings depending on the contexts it is placed in. 
					</li>
					<li>
					Say an array contains a list of subclasses of one original class, in this case the array has a technical term of a “polymorphic array”.
					</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p class="lead">
					<br><br><strong>Encapsulation:</strong>
<br>Used to prevent attributes from being edited outside of the class. This can lead to problems if other values are dependent on these variables, as they may not be updated with the new values. 
<br><br>To accomplish the desired result we use encapsulation where some aspects are set to private (cannot be accessed outside the class) and some to public. 
<br><br>Therefore we could still change the value of the variables, but the other dependent variables would change accordingly with the public method.

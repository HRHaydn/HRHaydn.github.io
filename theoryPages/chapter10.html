					<strong>Gordon Moore</strong>, founder of Intel®, predicted in 1965 that the number of transistors would double approximately every two years. This trend is described as Moore’s Law. Doubling the number os transistors (into the same space) increases the speed of the processor.<br>
					<br>
					Although this trend is beginning to show an end as physical limitations begin to become more apparent, there is still evidence of the effects of Moore’s Law as processor speed continues to grow exponentially.</p>

				<strong>What is a register?</strong><br>
				A register is a memory location within the CPU.<br>
				The registers themselves are extremely fast and can be used without causing a bottleneck (the slowest part of the system that limits the speed as a whole).</p>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-lg-6">
						<p class="lead"><br>
						<br>
						<strong>Program Counter:</strong><br>
						Keeps track of the memory location of the line of machine code being executed. It gets incremented to point to the next instruction, with each cycle of the fetch-decode-execute cycle allowing the program to be executed in sequence one by one.<br>
						The program counter is also affected by instructions which alter the flow of control - for example LMC has BRZ, BRP and BRA.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Memory Data Register (MDR):</strong><br>
						Stores the data that has been fetched from or stored in memory.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Memory Address Register (MAR):</strong><br>
						Stores the address of the data or instructions that are to be fetched from or sent to.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Current Instruction Register (CIR):</strong><br>
						Stores the most recently fetched instructions, waiting to be decoded and executed.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Accumulator (ACC):</strong><br>
						Stores the results of calculations made by the ALU.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>General Purpose Registers:</strong><br>
						Processors can also have general purpose registers, which can temporarily store data rather than sending data to and from the comparatively much slower memory.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-6">
						<p class="lead"><br>
						<br>
						<strong>Buses:</strong><br>
						Buses are communications channels through which data can be sent around the computer. There are three buses inside the computer we need to consider:<br>
						<strong>Data Bus</strong> - carries data between the processor and memory.<br>
						<strong>Address Bus</strong> - carries the address of the memory location being read from or written to.<br>
						<strong>Control Bus</strong> - sends control signals from the control unit.<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):</strong><br>
						Carries out calculations and logical decisions. Results are stored in the accumulator.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Control Unit (CU):</strong><br>
						Sends out signals to coordinate how the processor works. It controls the how data moves around parts of the CPU and how it moves between the CPU and memory. Instructions are decoded in the control unit.</p>

				<p class="lead"><strong>Cache Memory</strong><br>
				RAM is faster when compared to the speed of secondary storage, however it is still slower in comparison the CPU - making RAM a bottleneck in the speed at which processor can operate.<br>
				To improve upon this, a small amount of fast memory is built into the processor itself reducing the distance data has to travel - this is Cache Memory. By anticipating regularly used data and moving them to Cache, the overall speed of the processor can be improved. As well as being expensive however, larger sizes of cache work slower and therefore often modern computers have multiple levels of cache.</p>

				<p class="lead"><strong>Multiple Cores:</strong><br>
				A CPU can have multiple cores, the most common being “dual core” and “quad core” processors. Each core is a distinct processing unit on the CPU, as well as having its own cache the cores also share a higher-level cache that works directly with RAM.<br>
				When multitasking, each core can work on different applications. Through parallel processing it is also possible for multiple cores to work on the same task. Four cores does not mean the processor will work four times as fast.</p>

				<p class="lead"><strong>Pipelining:</strong><br>
				Pipelining is a method used within processors, with one instruction being executed, the next instruction being decoded all while the the one after being fetched from memory. 
				Sometimes it is not able to be accurate when predicting what instruction needs to be fetched and decoded next. For example we might need to branch to another instruction. This is called flushing the pipeline. 
				The more we have to the flush the pipeline, the less benefit pipelining gives us. <br><br>
				Imagine a manual car wash: one person fetches the water, another cleans the car and finally someone rinses the car off. </p>

				A GPU is a processing unit specifically designed to perform calculations associated with graphics. 
				They have instruction sets specifically designed for the sorts of calculations required in graphics processing. <br>
